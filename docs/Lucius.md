The main choice here is either the Magic core or the Modest core as your need for health on your tanks dictate. The difference in damage isn't as vast as it is with other magic champions though so really this comes down to personal preference.

Don't let the damage of the Aerois core fool you though. It might not seem even slightly comparable - but if you're using the Aerois team - it will likely out-perform the other cores. Though - you will need the *entire* team for that to be the case - which is why I'm not recommending it generally. It also doesn't have any health - just like the Magic core - which isn't doing it any favours either.

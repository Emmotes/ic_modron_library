The Magic and Aerois cores are so far ahead of the other cores that they are really the only choices for Lucius. Choose whichever you have the more favourable pipes for.

Note that the damage of the Aerois core varies depending on the number of Aerois champions in the formation. The damage numbers on the layout above account for just 1 (Lucius only). For a specific breakdown of how the core fares with more Aerois champions - check the table below.


| Core | Num Aerois Champions | Total Damage |
|---|---|---|
| Aerois | 5 | 1.84e58% |
| Aerois | 4 | 4.72e52% |
| Aerois | 3 | 1.21e47% |
| Aerois | 2 | 3.09e41% |
| Aerois | 1 | 7.91e35% |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|   | ![Melee Icon](images/melee.png) |   | Strong | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/T6WKqVL4iKEh9StNykvRh](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/T6WKqVL4iKEh9StNykvRh) | 1.16e39% |
| ![Magic Icon](images/magic.png) | ![Melee Icon](images/melee.png) | ![Ranged Icon](images/ranged.png) | Modest | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/j3JuHVefg7DnKYc9OuwAi](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/j3JuHVefg7DnKYc9OuwAi) | 1.58e36% |

The Strong core is far enough ahead of the Modest core that it's the best one to use for Minsc. That said - you could potentially use the Modest core if the pipes you have favour it.

The Magic core has not been included because it would be missing too many nodes to be a viable choice.

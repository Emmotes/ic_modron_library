# Minsc

Minsc is in the Heroes of Baldur's Gate affiliation and benefits from the following stat nodes:

* Strength
* Constitution

Minsc is a melee champion.

|---|---|---|---|
| ![Strong Core](images/core_2_strong.png) | Strong | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/T6WKqVL4iKEh9StNykvRh](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/T6WKqVL4iKEh9StNykvRh) | 1.16e39% |
| ![Modest Core](images/core_1_modest.png) | Modest | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/j3JuHVefg7DnKYc9OuwAi](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/j3JuHVefg7DnKYc9OuwAi) | 1.58e36% |

The Strong core is far enough ahead of the Modest core that it's the best one to use for Minsc. That said - you could potentially use the Modest core if the pipes you have favour it.

The Magic core has not been included because it would be missing too many nodes to be a viable choice.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|   | ![Melee Icon](images\melee.png) |   | Strong  | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/VHq6p4u6_NiViLkKL0Xlw](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/VHq6p4u6_NiViLkKL0Xlw) | 1.16e39% |
| ![Magic Icon](images\magic.png) | ![Melee Icon](images\melee.png) | ![Ranged Icon](images\ranged.png) | Modest  | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/j3JuHVefg7DnKYc9OuwAi](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/j3JuHVefg7DnKYc9OuwAi) | 1.58e36% |

The Strong core wins by a big enough margin here that you'd really need some amazing pipes for the Modest core that you can't use on the Strong core for the Modest to be a consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Magic core has not been included because it would be missing too many nodes to be a viable choice.

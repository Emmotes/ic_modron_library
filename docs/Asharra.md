The Magic core is far enough ahead of the Unaffiliated core that it's the best one to use for Asharra. That said - you could potentially use the Unaffiliated core if the pipes you have favour it. Though it is worth noting that the Magic core doesn't have any health nodes - which could influence your choice.

Note that the damage of the Unaffiliated core varies depending on the number of unaffiliated champions in the formation. The damage numbers on the layout above account for just 1 (Asharra only).

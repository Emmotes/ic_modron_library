Asharra is an interesting birb because she gets to use every single node in the Magic core - but loses out on Strength Dexterity and Constitution nodes in every other core. As a result - the Magic core is just *so far ahead* of every other core for her that there really is no sensible alternative. Basically - get used to squishy tanks.

I only included the Modest and Strong cores for the sake of comparison. Just look at the difference in exponents.

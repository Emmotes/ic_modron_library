|---|---|---|---|
| ![Strong Core](images/core_2_strong.png) | Strong | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/SI2dcRz6izSQIPntS9Q0U](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/SI2dcRz6izSQIPntS9Q0U) | 2.43e43% |

| ![Magic Core](images/core_4_magic.png) | Magic (Non-Magic Variant) | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/5qQI-zlqFfl1V2U9JUKC4](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/5qQI-zlqFfl1V2U9JUKC4) | 2.19e41% |

The listed cores are all similar enough in damage for Fen that you should use whichever you have the more favourable pipes for. Though I would not recommend the Magic core as it doesn't have any health nodes.

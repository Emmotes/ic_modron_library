# Krond

Krond benefits from the following stat nodes:

* Strength
* Constitution
* Intelligence
* Wisdom

Krond is normally melee - but he also becomes magic after choosing a specialisation. This means he can benefit from both Melee and Magic nodes.

The damage of the Magic core is a wide enough margin ahead of the Strong core for Krond that it could be worth using. That said - as always - the Magic core has no health - which can be a big problem. Use the Strong core if that's your limiting factor.

# Krond

Krond is unaffiliated and benefits from the following stat nodes:

* Strength
* Constitution
* Intelligence
* Wisdom

Krond is normally a melee champion but he also becomes magic after choosing a specialisation. This means he can benefit from both Melee and Magic nodes.

The Magic and Unaffiliated cores are so far ahead of the Strong core that they are really the only choices for Krond. Choose whichever you have the more favourable pipes for - though I would not recommend the Magic core as it doesn't have any health nodes.

Note that the damage of the Unaffiliated core varies depending on the number of unaffiliated champions in the formation. The damage numbers on the layout above account for just 1 (Krond only). For a specific breakdown of how the core fares with more unaffiliated champions - check the table below.

| Core | Num Unaffiliated in Formation | Total Damage |
|---|---|---|
| Unaffiliated | 10 | 1.04e53% |
| Unaffiliated | 9 | 6.81e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 8 | 4.26e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 7 | 2.50e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 6 | 1.35e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 5 | 6.56e51% |
| Unaffiliated | 4 | 2.70e51% |
| Unaffiliated | 3 | 8.63e50% |
| Unaffiliated | 2 | 1.74e50% |
| Unaffiliated | 1 | 1.15e49% |

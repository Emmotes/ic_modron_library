# Highly Optimised Modrons Library

This is designed to be a library where you can find more or less any modron core you need. Whether it be for a specific DPS champion - an achievement - or even reference designs for when levelling up your core.

If you can improve any of the cores below or have ideas for types of cores that should be added - please do DM me on Discord. Add byteglow links as necessary.

# Supercharged Damage Designs

These cores are the current best-known supercharge designs and essentially use unlimited pipes. Most people don't have enough to copy these layouts in their entirety - so some improvisation will be required.

The damage cores are listed by DPS champion - so choose the one you normally use - or whoever you've put most of your legendaries into. If - however - you tend to use multiple DPS champions regularly - then you'll want to look into using a core based on champions that benefit from every node in that core. That will mean no matter who you use - they'll always be buffed.

For the Modest and Strong cores that will be Artemis. For the Magic core that will be Asharra. For the Aerois core that's Lucius.

You could always save a layout for each of the DPS champions you use and swap between them in-game but frankly that's boring and tedious.

If you try to copy/improvise these designs and you lack the pipes to reach 5.2e8 flow (500% bonus) by the time the reference designs stop adding buff boxes - ignore the reference designs and keep adding buff boxes. The reference designs switch to minimal mode purely to save pipes. Your aim is to get as many nodes to 500% bonus as possible - so keep pumping up that flow.

If you're unsure whether you've made the best design you can when you're done - put the Byteglow link in the [#modron_core_layout](https://discord.com/channels/357247482247380994/733401533579788397) channel in the Discord and someone will usually be available to try to help find some optimisations.

# Achievement Designs

These cores have been designed specifically to get the achievements and should not be used for damage - you will definitely be able to do better. We've also attempted to design these using the minimal pipes necessary to get the achievements - though of course depending on the pipes you have available improvisation will likely be required.

Despite what may be implied from reading the achievement descriptions - the supercharge ones require every single node in the core to receive supercharge flow - even if they cannot benefit from being supercharged.

If a core is not listed - it's because it's impossible to get the achievement with that core.

## Now We're Flowing

This achievement requires 1,000 (1.00e3) flow to every node for a 25% supercharge bonus.

These reference layouts contain full epic designs for levels 1 through 15. They are to be used as inspiration when levelling up your modron cores.

These designs were built almost exclusively by `Retaki` in their [Modron Core Piping Strategies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jGg5cZHENV1Dbrp-n2EeM_gNxuYJxRrvHlv4gE2pKQw/) guide.

# Fast Core Supercharge Layouts

I have only linked the Fast core on Nahara's damage page because it simply cannot compete for most champions. It will always be the worst for damage. Even for Nahara it's only there because it aids her speed effect. That said - it does have some supercharged designs if you really want to use it.

The Fully Supercharged design - as its name implies - has linked every single node. This is mostly because the Fast core's primary purpose is gem farming and that needs gold for increasing the click damage wall. You can always save an alternate layout that doesn't use gold nodes to possibly increase damage further.

The "Budget" Supercharged design is a modification of the Fully Supercharged design - and uses fewer cross pipes to get similar levels of damage. It's only slightly easier to build (hence the quotation marks). The main benefit of this layout over the Fully Supercharged design is that it uses a slightly more forgiving flow-path on the right-hand side - which is useful if you don't have all the necessary pipes and need to downgrade sections.

# Variable Core Damage Information

Some modron cores have damage that is variable based on the composition of the champions in the formation. Below are some tables that detail the damage each one can provide at most based on the composition.

## Aerois Core

The damage of the Aerois core depends on whether you are using Lucius as your chosen DPS and how many other Heroes of Aerois champions you are using.

*Note: These tables assume 500% supercharge on all superchargeable nodes.*

As you can see - the damage falls off rapidly when you are not using Lucius or many Aerois champions. As such - I've only added the Aerois core to [Lucius'](Lucius.md) champion page.

| With Lucius DPS<br />Num Aerois in Formation | Bonus |   | Other DPS<br />Num Aerois in Formation | Bonus |
|--:|--:|---|--:|--:|
| 5 | 1.84e58% |   | 4 | 2.24e48% |
| 4 | 4.72e52% |   | 3 | 5.74e42% |
| 3 | 1.21e47% |   | 2 | 1.47e37% |
| 2 | 3.09e41% |   | 1 | 3.76e31% |
| 1 | 7.91e35% |   | 0 | 6.02e28% |

## Unaffiliated Core

The damage of the Unaffiliated core depends on whether you are using an unaffiliated champion as your chosen DPS and how many other unaffiliated champions are in the formation.

*Note: These tables assume 500% supercharge on all superchargeable nodes.*

As you can see - the damage is really poor for affiliated champions. As such - this core has only been added to unaffiliated dps champions' pages.

| With Unaffiliated DPS<br />Num Unaffiliated in Formation | Bonus |   | With Affiliated DPS<br />Num Unaffiliated in Formation | Bonus |

## Where is the best place to get modron pipes?

The Modron Component Chests are - currently - the only source of modron pipes. You get 1 each time you level up a modron core - to a maximum level of 15. You can also get up to 4 each week by purchasing 1 from each patron's shop for 5,000 currency - and you should strive to unlock the patrons and get enough influence to be doing that ASAP.

Other places to get component chests are from Seasons or Emergences - and the occasional giveaway. Also - the final variant in both Tomb of Annihilation and Waterdeep: Dragonheist campaigns each give 5 for completing them.

## What should I spend Upgrade Components on?

Nothing. Save them.

The only time you should start spending components is when you have a handful of blue multi-in T pipes that need to be purple on fully supercharged layouts to get you to optimal. If you spend them before that - you could end up with too many of the upgraded pipe and not enough of another kind that you need and no more upgrade components to spend.

## Is it worth dismantling pipes?

No! Never dismantle pipes to get upgrade components! Ever! Don't even think about it! I cannot stress enough that dismantling pipes is a terrible idea!

The conversion rate to upgrade components and the cost to upgrade pipes are absolutely terrible. You also never know when you might need that pipe you're thinking of dismantling.

## Why don't you pipe gold nodes?

Using them often lowers flow to the damage nodes and damage is the whole point of supercharging. If you need gold then it's best to load a different layout temporarily or use a different core.

## Why do you pipe Health nodes in the Modest and Strong cores then?

If you want less health and more damage then you're usually going to be much better off using the Magic Core. If you're using the Modest or Strong cores then it's likely because you want the extra health - and you're willing to lose damage because of it.

## Is the Aerois Core worth buying from Wild Offers?

Not really no. It's only good if you use the entirety of the Aerois affiliation with Lucius as your dps. If don't use all of them - then the Magic core is better - even for Lucius. And the core itself is terrible for every other dps (see the [Variable Core Damage Information](#variablesTab) tab for more details).

There are only two small tangible benefits to the Aerois core. The first is that it starts out with the Automation node available at level 1 - which means it's good for background parties immediately. The second is that levelling it to 15 nets you 14 Modron Component Chests.

In the end though - it's your money - and we all value things differently. So it's up to you to decide if those minor benefits are worth it for you.

# Credits

Getting these highly optimised designs hasn't been a one person job. It's been a huge community effort with a lot of back-and-forth of improvements between many people.

I personally want to thank `UniQP` most of all though. This is as much their project as mine - and they have easily contributed the most to this library with innumerable optimisations. It simply wouldn't be what it is without their input.

Of course - others have contributed as well - and the most notable include:

* `Retaki`
* `Midander`
* `Ridge`
* `Cuddlegutz`

Also a big thank you to `Uffdah` for the modron tool on Byteglow.

If you improve any of the designs in this guide - you'll end up on this list too (unless you specifically ask me otherwise).

# Feedback

Please do feel free to contact me via a DM on the Discord if you can think of anything that might improve this guide. I'm `emmote` - the one with the Prudence avatar.

I might not always agree with ideas offered - but I'll always read them and give them some thought.

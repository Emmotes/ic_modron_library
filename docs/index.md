# Highly Optimised Modrons Library

This is designed to be a library where you can find more or less any modron core you need. Whether it be for a specific DPS champion - or an achievement.

If you can improve any of the cores below - please do DM me on Discord new links with the stats/champion and core type.

# Damage Cores

These cores are the current best-known supercharge designs and essentially use unlimited pipes. Most people don't have enough to copy these layouts in their entirety - so some improvisation will be required.

If you try to copy/improvise these designs and you lack the pipes to reach 5.2e8 flow (500% bonus) by the time the reference designs stop adding buff boxes - ignore the reference designs and keep adding buff boxes. The reference designs switch to minimal mode purely to save pipes. Your aim is to get as many nodes to 500% bonus as possible - so keep pumping up that flow.

If you're unsure whether you've made the best design you can when you're done - put the Byteglow link in the [#modron_core_layout](https://discord.com/channels/357247482247380994/733401533579788397) channel in the Discord and someone will usually be available to try to help find some optimisations.

# Reference Designs

The vast majority of these designs were built almost exclusively by `Retaki` in their [Modron Core Piping Strategies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jGg5cZHENV1Dbrp-n2EeM_gNxuYJxRrvHlv4gE2pKQw/) guide. Whereas the damage cores above are all supercharged - these mostly contain general Full Epic layouts for levels 1 through 15 for their respective core.

This is currently a work-in-progress. More designs will be added over time.

# Achievement Cores

These cores have been designed specifically to get the achievements and should not be used for damage - you will definitely be able to do better. We've also attempted to design these using the minimal pipes necessary to get the achievements - though of course depending on the pipes you have available improvisation will likely be required.

Despite what may be implied from reading the achievement descriptions - the supercharge ones require every single node in the core to receive supercharge flow - even if they cannot benefit from being supercharged.

If a core is not listed - it’s because it’s impossible to get the achievement with that core.

### Now We're Flowing

# Fast Cores

I have not linked the Fast core for any of the DPS champions because it simply cannot compete. It will always be the worst for damage. That said - it does have a fully supercharged design if you really want to use it.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ![Magic Icon](images\magic.png) | ![Melee Icon](images\melee.png) | ![Ranged Icon](images\ranged.png) | Fully Supercharged | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/ozwp3wQr7O3VHUmKffQtv](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/ozwp3wQr7O3VHUmKffQtv) | 1.03e39% |

The Fully Supercharged design - as its name implies - has linked every single node. This is mostly because the Fast core’s primary purpose is gem farming and that needs gold for increasing the click damage wall. You can always save an alternate layout that doesn’t use gold nodes to possibly increase damage further.

The Minimal no damage design is for when you’re supercharging another core and need all the pipes you can get - but still want your Fast core piped up for gem farming. It uses no epic pieces - no cross pieces - and only 9 rare pieces. Since gem farming doesn’t need champion damage - unless you’re modron stacking - those nodes are ignored.

# FAQs

Just a list of frequently asked questions. If you have a question - feel free to DM me on Discord.

### Why don’t you pipe gold nodes?

Using them often lowers flow to the damage nodes and damage is the whole point of supercharging. If you need gold then it's best to load a different layout temporarily or use a different core.

The Modest core has the highest gold bonus of 2.19e6% when fully epic - shortly followed by the Fast core at 1.20e6%.

### Why do you pipe Health nodes in the Modest and Strong cores then?

If you want less health and more damage then you're usually going to be much better off using the Magic Core. If you're using the Modest or Strong cores then it's likely because you want the extra health - and you’re willing to lose damage because of it.

# Credits

Getting these highly optimised designs hasn’t been a one person job. It's been a huge community effort with a lot of back-and-forth of improvements between many people.

I personally want to thank `UniQP` most of all though. This is as much their project as mine - and they have easily contributed the most to this library with innumerable optimisations. It simply wouldn't be what it is without their input.

Of course - others have contributed as well - and the most notable include:
* `Retaki`
* `Midander`
* `Ridge`
* `Cuddlegutz`

Also a big thank you to `Uffdah` for the modron tool on Byteglow.

If you improve any of the designs in this guide - you’ll end up on this list too (unless you specifically ask me otherwise).

# Feedback

Please do feel free to contact me via a DM on the Discord if you can think of anything that might improve this guide. I’m Emmote#5443 - the one with the Prudence avatar.

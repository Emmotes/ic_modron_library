# Highly Optimised Modrons Library

This is designed to be a library where you can find more or less any modron core you need. Whether it be for a specific DPS champion - an achievement - or even reference designs for when levelling up your core.

If you can improve any of the cores below or have ideas for types of cores that should be added - please do DM me on Discord. Add byteglow links as necessary.

# Damage Cores

These cores are the current best-known supercharge designs and essentially use unlimited pipes. Most people don't have enough to copy these layouts in their entirety - so some improvisation will be required.

The damage cores are listed by DPS champion - so choose the one you normally use - or whoever you've put most of your legendaries into. If - however - you tend to use multiple DPS champions regularly - then you'll want to look into using a core based on champions that benefit from every node in that core. That will mean no matter who you use - they'll always be buffed.

For the Modest and Strong cores that will be Artemis. For the Magic core that will be Asharra. For the Aerois core that's Lucius.

You could always save a layout for each of the DPS champions you use and swap between them in-game but frankly that's boring and tedious.

If you try to copy/improvise these designs and you lack the pipes to reach 5.2e8 flow (500% bonus) by the time the reference designs stop adding buff boxes - ignore the reference designs and keep adding buff boxes. The reference designs switch to minimal mode purely to save pipes. Your aim is to get as many nodes to 500% bonus as possible - so keep pumping up that flow.

If you're unsure whether you've made the best design you can when you're done - put the Byteglow link in the [#modron_core_layout](https://discord.com/channels/357247482247380994/733401533579788397) channel in the Discord and someone will usually be available to try to help find some optimisations.

# Achievement Cores

These cores have been designed specifically to get the achievements and should not be used for damage - you will definitely be able to do better. We've also attempted to design these using the minimal pipes necessary to get the achievements - though of course depending on the pipes you have available improvisation will likely be required.

Despite what may be implied from reading the achievement descriptions - the supercharge ones require every single node in the core to receive supercharge flow - even if they cannot benefit from being supercharged.

If a core is not listed - it's because it's impossible to get the achievement with that core.

## Now We're Flowing

This achievement requires 1,000 (1.00e3) flow to every node for a 25% supercharge bonus.

# Fast Cores

I have only linked the Fast core on Nahara's page because it simply cannot compete for most champions. It will always be the worst for damage. Even for Nahara it's only there because it aids her speed effect. That said - it does have some supercharged designs if you really want to use it.

|---|---|---|---|
| ![Fast Core](images/core_3_fast.png) | Fully Supercharged | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/ozwp3wQr7O3VHUmKffQtv](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/ozwp3wQr7O3VHUmKffQtv) | 1.03e39% |
| ![Fast Core](images/core_3_fast.png) | "Budget" Supercharged | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/FN7JOvNteXk4heA0EY4ec](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/FN7JOvNteXk4heA0EY4ec) | 9.73e38% |

The Fully Supercharged design - as its name implies - has linked every single node. This is mostly because the Fast core's primary purpose is gem farming and that needs gold for increasing the click damage wall. You can always save an alternate layout that doesn't use gold nodes to possibly increase damage further.

The "Budget" Supercharged design is a modification of the Fully Supercharged design - and uses fewer cross pipes to get similar levels of damage. It's only slightly easier to build (hence the quotation marks). The main benefit of this layout over the Fully Supercharged design is that it uses a slightly more forgiving flow-path on the right-hand side - which is useful if you don't have all the necessary pipes and need to downgrade sections.

<br />
# Reference Designs

The vast majority of these designs were built almost exclusively by `Retaki` in their [Modron Core Piping Strategies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jGg5cZHENV1Dbrp-n2EeM_gNxuYJxRrvHlv4gE2pKQw/) guide. Whereas the damage cores above are all supercharged - these mostly contain general Full Epic layouts for levels 1 through 15 for their respective core.

* [Modest Core](ref_modest.md)
* [Strong Core](ref_strong.md)
* [Fast Core](ref_fast.md)
* [Magic Core](ref_magic.md)
* [Aerois Core](ref_aerois.md)
* [Unaffiliated Core](ref_unaffiliated.md)
* [Unofficial Leaderboards](ref_leaderboard.md)

<br />
# Aerois Core Damage Tables

The damage of the Aerois core depends on whether you are using Lucius as your chosen DPS and how many other Heroes of Aerois champions you are using. Below is a table detailing those numbers.

*Note: These tables assume 500% supercharge on all superchargeable nodes.*

As you can see - the damage falls off rapidly when you are not using Lucius or many Aerois champions. As such - I've only added the Aerois core to [Lucius'](Lucius.md) champion page.

| With Lucius DPS<br />Num Aerois in Formation | Bonus |   | Other DPS<br />Num Aerois in Formation | Bonus |
|--:|--:|---|--:|--:|
| 5 | 1.84e58% |   | 4 | 2.24e48% |
| 4 | 4.72e52% |   | 3 | 5.74e42% |
| 3 | 1.21e47% |   | 2 | 1.47e37% |
| 2 | 3.09e41% |   | 1 | 3.76e31% |
| 1 | 7.91e35% |   | 0 | 6.02e28% |

<br />
# Unaffiliated Core Damage Tables

The damage of the Unaffiliated core depends on whether you are using an unaffiliated champion as your chosen DPS and how many other unaffiliated champions are in the formation. Below is a table detailing those numbers.

*Note: These tables assume 500% supercharge on all superchargeable nodes.*

As you can see - the damage is really poor for affiliated champions. As such - this core has only been added to unaffiliated dps champions' pages.

| With Unaffiliated DPS<br />Num Unaffiliated in Formation | Bonus |   | With Affiliated DPS<br />Num Unaffiliated in Formation | Bonus |
|--:|--:|---|--:|--:|
| 10 | 1.04e53% |   | 9 | 8.24e38% |
| 9 | 6.81e52% |   | 8 | 5.15e38% |
| 8 | 4.26e52% |   | 7 | 3.03e38% |
| 7 | 2.50e52% |   | 6 | 1.64e38% |
| 6 | 1.35e52% |   | 5 | 7.93e37% |
| 5 | 6.56e51% |   | 4 | 3.27e37% |
| 4 | 2.70e51% |   | 3 | 1.04e37% |
| 3 | 8.63e50% |   | 2 | 2.10e36% |
| 2 | 1.74e50% |   | 1 | 1.39e35% |
| 1 | 1.15e49% |   | 0 | 8.01e28% |

# FAQs

Just a list of frequently asked questions. If you have a question - feel free to DM me on Discord.

## Where can each modron core be found?

| Icon | Name | Id | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| ![Modest Core](images/core_1_modest.png) | `Modest` | 1 | Split the Party 1 (2+ champions in all seats) |
| ![Strong Core](images/core_2_strong.png) | `Strong` | 2 | 500,000 Gems |
| ![Fast Core](images/core_3_fast.png) | `Fast` | 3 | Split the Party 2 (3+ champions in all seats) |
| ![Magic Core](images/core_4_magic.png) | `Magic` | 4 | Split the Party 3 (4+ champions in all seats) |
| ![Aerois Core](images/core_5_aerois.png) | `Aerois` | 5 | Season 1 / Wild Offers |
| ![Unaffiliated Core](images/core_6_unaffiliated.png) | `Unaffiliated` | 6 | Season 3 |

## Which is the best gold find core?

The Modest core has the highest gold bonus of 2.19e06% when fully epic - while the Fast core is the next best at 1.20e06%.

| Icon | Core | Gold Find Bonus |
|---|---|---|
| ![Modest Core](images/core_1_modest.png) | Modest | 2.19e06% |
| ![Fast Core](images/core_3_fast.png) | Fast | 1.20e06% |
| ![Aerois Core](images/core_5_aerois.png) | Aerois | 3.78e05% |
| ![Magic Core](images/core_4_magic.png) | Magic | 3.78e05% |
| ![Strong Core](images/core_2_strong.png) | Strong | 3.78e05% |
| ![Unaffiliated Core](images/core_6_unaffiliated.png) | Unaffiliated | 1.19e05% |

## Why don't you pipe gold nodes?

Using them often lowers flow to the damage nodes and damage is the whole point of supercharging. If you need gold then it's best to load a different layout temporarily or use a different core.

## Why do you pipe Health nodes in the Modest and Strong cores then?

If you want less health and more damage then you're usually going to be much better off using the Magic Core. If you're using the Modest or Strong cores then it's likely because you want the extra health - and you're willing to lose damage because of it.

# Credits

Getting these highly optimised designs hasn't been a one person job. It's been a huge community effort with a lot of back-and-forth of improvements between many people.

I personally want to thank `UniQP` most of all though. This is as much their project as mine - and they have easily contributed the most to this library with innumerable optimisations. It simply wouldn't be what it is without their input.

Of course - others have contributed as well - and the most notable include:

* `Retaki`
* `Midander`
* `Ridge`
* `Cuddlegutz`

Also a big thank you to `Uffdah` for the modron tool on Byteglow.

If you improve any of the designs in this guide - you'll end up on this list too (unless you specifically ask me otherwise).

<br />
# Feedback

Please do feel free to contact me via a DM on the Discord if you can think of anything that might improve this guide. I'm `emmote` - the one with the Prudence avatar.

I might not always agree with ideas offered - but I'll always read them and give them some thought.

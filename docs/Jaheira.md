Jaheira is a melee champion.

|---|---|---|---|
| ![Strong Core](images/core_2_strong.png) | Strong | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/P6YiBeAtM8eZSSjm6hI9H](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/P6YiBeAtM8eZSSjm6hI9H) | 2.13e43% |
| ![Modest Core](images/core_1_modest.png) | Modest | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/6Yv_YlUxFfujj05FwG9ed](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/6Yv_YlUxFfujj05FwG9ed) | 1.50e42% |
| ![Magic Core](images/core_4_magic.png) | Magic (Non-Magic Variant) | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/c23hOzJAH6rdvgsf5yKeZ](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/c23hOzJAH6rdvgsf5yKeZ) | 1.82e41% |

The listed cores are all similar enough in damage for Jaheira that you should use whichever you have the more favourable pipes for. Though I would not recommend the Magic core as it doesn't have any health nodes.

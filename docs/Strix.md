# Strix

Strix is in the Acquisitions Incorporated and Waffle Crew affiliations and benefits from the following stat nodes:

* Constitution
* Intelligence
* Charisma

Strix is a magic champion.

|---|---|---|---|
| ![Magic Core](images/core_4_magic.png) | Magic | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/1QAVPgKXTPpv6QyZmNM3l](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/1QAVPgKXTPpv6QyZmNM3l) | 1.71e49% |
| ![Modest Core](images/core_1_modest.png) | Modest | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/eS2YlQByPi6gqBWarBSEA](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/eS2YlQByPi6gqBWarBSEA) | 2.57e38% |
| ![Strong Core](images/core_2_strong.png) | Strong (Non-Melee Variant) | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/pv1IBDYJeGoBaQpSTzCOE](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/pv1IBDYJeGoBaQpSTzCOE) | 9.45e36% |

The Magic core is so far ahead of the other cores that it's really the only choice for Strix. Though it is worth noting that it doesn't have any health nodes.

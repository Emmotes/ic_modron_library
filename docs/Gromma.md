# Gromma

Gromma benefits from the following stat nodes:
* Strength
* Constitution
* Intelligence (with Feat)
* Wisdom
* Charisma

Gromma is normally a melee champion but her Swamp specialisation will make her a magic attacker instead - and that is the specialisation you will use if she's a DPS.

The clear winner here is the default Magic core by a wide margin. The difference in damage is so significant that I don't really think using the Modest core for health is worth it unless you're able to get to extremely high zones where health will be your limiting factor.

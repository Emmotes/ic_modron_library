# Gromma

Gromma is unaffiliated and benefits from the following stat nodes:

* Strength
* Constitution
* Intelligence (with Feat)
* Wisdom
* Charisma

Gromma is normally a melee champion but her Swamp specialisation will make her a magic attacker instead - and that is the specialisation you will use if she's a DPS.

The Magic core is far enough ahead of the Unaffiliated core that it's the best one to use for Gromma. That said - you could potentially use the Unaffiliated core if the pipes you have favour it. Though it is worth noting that the Magic core doesn't have any health nodes - which could influence your choice.

Note that the damage of the Unaffiliated core varies depending on the number of unaffiliated champions in the formation. The damage numbers on the layout above account for just 1 (Gromma only). For a specific breakdown of how the core fares with more unaffiliated champions - check the table below.

| Core | Num Unaffiliated in Formation | Total Damage |
|---|---|---|
| Unaffiliated | 10 | 1.04e53% |
| Unaffiliated | 9 | 6.81e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 8 | 4.26e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 7 | 2.50e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 6 | 1.35e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 5 | 6.56e51% |
| Unaffiliated | 4 | 2.70e51% |
| Unaffiliated | 3 | 8.63e50% |
| Unaffiliated | 2 | 1.74e50% |

D'hani is a melee champion.

|---|---|---|---|

| ![Magic Core](images/core_4_magic.png) | Magic (Non-Magic Variant) | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/Y-dm5dFF-poiLBflC5f17](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/Y-dm5dFF-poiLBflC5f17) | 1.91e41% |
| ![Modest Core](images/core_1_modest.png) | Modest | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/tFUbbSl60Q161is_ovBxs](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/tFUbbSl60Q161is_ovBxs) | 1.57e40% |

The listed cores are all similar enough in damage for D'hani that you should use whichever you have the more favourable pipes for. Though I would not recommend the Magic core as it doesn't have any health nodes.

# JSON Files
There are three files in this folder:

* layouts_damage
* layouts_achievements
* layouts_reference

These should be fairly self explanatory.

## Layouts_Damage
These are byteglow designs supercharged for damage and for specific DPS champions.

## Layouts_Achievements
These are byteglow designs made specifically for getting the achievements.

## Layouts_Reference
These are byteglow designs used as reference material - either for low level modrons or pre-supercharge.

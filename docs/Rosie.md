The Magic (Non-Magic Variant) core is far enough ahead of the other cores that it's the best one to use for Rosie. That said - you could potentially use the Strong or Modest core if the pipes you have favours one of them. Though it is worth noting that the Magic core doesn't have any health nodes - which could influence your choice.

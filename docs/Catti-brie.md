The Modest core wins by a very small margin over the non-melee variant of the Strong core. Enough that you may find either one out-performing the other based on the pipes you have. So use whichever you have the more favourable pipes for.

I do not recommend the Magic core. It's practically identical in damage to the non-melee variant of the Strong core - but has no health.

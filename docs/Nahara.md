The clear winner here is the default Magic core by a wide margin. The difference in damage is so significant that I don't really think using the Modest core for health is worth it unless you're able to get to extremely high zones where health will be your limiting factor.

The Fast core has been added for Nahara not because it's viable for damage - but because she's sometimes used in gem farming runs - and she only provides her speed while she can one-hit-kill enemies. The more damage she has - the longer she can provide her speed.

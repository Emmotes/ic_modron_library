The Unaffiliated core is so far ahead of the other cores that it's really the only choice for Binwin.

The Magic core has not been included because it would be missing too many nodes to be a viable choice.

Note that the damage of the Unaffiliated core varies depending on the number of unaffiliated champions in the formation. The damage numbers on the layout above account for just 1 (Binwin only). For a specific breakdown of how the core fares with more unaffiliated champions - check the table below.

| Core | Num Unaffiliated in Formation | Total Damage |
|---|---|---|
| Unaffiliated | 10 | 1.04e53% |
| Unaffiliated | 9 | 6.81e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 8 | 4.26e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 7 | 2.50e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 6 | 1.35e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 5 | 6.56e51% |
| Unaffiliated | 4 | 2.70e51% |
| Unaffiliated | 3 | 8.63e50% |
| Unaffiliated | 2 | 1.74e50% |
| Unaffiliated | 1 | 1.15e49% |

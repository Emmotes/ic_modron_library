# Orisha

Orisha is in the Sirens of the Realms affiliation and benefits from the following stat nodes:

* Strength
* Dexterity
* Intelligence
* Wisdom
* Charisma

Orisha is a magic champion.

|---|---|---|---|
| ![Magic Core](images/core_4_magic.png) | Magic | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/8euk6u6PKHy_mmNX4S7ek](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/8euk6u6PKHy_mmNX4S7ek) | 2.83e53% |
| ![Modest Core](images/core_1_modest.png) | Modest | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/i8ZPac6myhxjSWsHC2F2L](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/i8ZPac6myhxjSWsHC2F2L) | 2.65e42% |
| ![Strong Core](images/core_2_strong.png) | Strong (Non-Melee Variant) | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/NlG6hux1O9m9xz5pvKjkM](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/NlG6hux1O9m9xz5pvKjkM) | 1.99e41% |

The Magic core is so far ahead of the other cores that it's really the only choice for Orisha. Though it is worth noting that it doesn't have any health nodes.

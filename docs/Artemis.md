I feel like you're going to be using the default Strong core. Whether you decide to drop one health node for a little more damage is up to you - but I wouldn't recommend it. It lowers the health bonus from 1875% to 240% - making tanks much squishier - and the gained damage is negligible. The non-magic variant of the Magic core got a new design and does come out on top for damage again - but it has no health at all - which can be a deal-breaker for a lot of people.\r\n\r\nNote that I've only added the less health variant of the Strong core for Artemis. You can use the same principle of removing health nodes for any core and any champion.

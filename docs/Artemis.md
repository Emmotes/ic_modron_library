The differences in damage between either of the cores for Artemis are largely negligible. Because of this - which core you choose is basically up to you. If you find that tank health is a factor in how far you can push then you'll want to avoid the Magic core entirely as it has no HP nodes. If tank health is not a concern though - use whichever you have the more favourable pipes for.

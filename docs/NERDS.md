# NERDS

NERDS benefits from the following stat nodes:
* Constitution

The NERDS can attack with all 3 types - depending on which Nerd is at the front - which is decided by the specialisation. The `Fighter` - `Cleric` and `Rogue` are melee. The `Ranger` is ranged. The `Bard` and `Wizard` are magic.

The Magic core does win out on damage for the `Bard` and `Wizard` but its lack of health is a big deal - especially on a champion that can be a tank without health share - and the damage isn't *too* much greater than the Strong core. Personally I'd recommend using a melee Nerd at the front and use the Strong core. That said - the Modest core would be an acceptable all-rounder for any Nerd.

The Unaffiliated core is far enough ahead of the Magic core that it's the best one to use for Dhadius. I do not recommend even trying the Magic core because it doesn't have any health nodes.

Note that the damage of the Unaffiliated core varies depending on the number of unaffiliated champions in the formation. The damage numbers on the layout above account for just 1 (Dhadius only). For a specific breakdown of how the core fares with more unaffiliated champions - check the table below.

| Core | Num Unaffiliated in Formation | Total Damage |
|---|---|---|
| Unaffiliated | 10 | 1.04e53% |
| Unaffiliated | 9 | 6.81e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 8 | 4.26e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 7 | 2.50e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 6 | 1.35e52% |
| Unaffiliated | 5 | 6.56e51% |
| Unaffiliated | 4 | 2.70e51% |
| Unaffiliated | 3 | 8.63e50% |
| Unaffiliated | 2 | 1.74e50% |
| Unaffiliated | 1 | 1.15e49% |

|---|---|---|---|
| ![Strong Core](images/core_2_strong.png) | Strong | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/Gp0kNQ05tR2pJtzgovLKe](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/Gp0kNQ05tR2pJtzgovLKe) | 1.68e41% |
| ![Modest Core](images/core_1_modest.png) | Modest | [https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/Z3dqepoGNtSI25cJzrPbj](https://ic.byteglow.com/modron/Z3dqepoGNtSI25cJzrPbj) | 3.05e40% |

The listed cores are all similar enough in damage for Torogar that you should use whichever you have the more favourable pipes for.

The Magic core has not been included because it would be missing too many nodes to be a viable choice.
